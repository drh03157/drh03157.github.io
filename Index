			<th> <h3>The Golden Ginkgo</h3></th>
			<p>The ginkgo <span style=font-style:italic>(Ginkgo biloba)</span> is a medium-sized tree native to the Orient, but widely planted in 
		the Southestern US. The ginkgo is considered a “living fossil,” in that there are no closely 
		related species still extant. Ginkgos are prized for their vivid yellow fall leaves. </p>
			<p>An unusual biological feature of the ginkgo is that it is a gymnosperm (“naked seed”), 
		meaning that the ginkgo seed is not encased in a fruit. In this the ginkgo resembles pine trees, 
		although the ginkgo is deciduous (loses its leaves in the winter).</p>
			<p>Ginkgos can be extremely long lived; one ginkgo in Shandong province, China is estimated 
		to be 3,000 years old. </p>
